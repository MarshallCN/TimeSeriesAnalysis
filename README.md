     - Numerical processing with NumPy

### 2. **Cluster Users Activity** (`cluster_users_activity.ipynb`)
   - **Description**: This notebook explores clustering techniques for analyzing user activity.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
     - Data preprocessing and scaling
     - Using `scikit-learn` for clustering

### 3. **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting** (`Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.ipynb`)
   - **Description**: This notebook is an end-to-end project on time series forecasting, possibly inspired by the Towards Data Science article.
